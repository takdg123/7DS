Despite its importance, it is hard to find a KN associated with a GW event, due to a poorly constrained GW localization map and numerous signals that could be confused as a KN. Here, we present the Gravitational-wave Electromagnetic wave Counterpart Korean Observatory (GECKO) project, the GECKO observation of GW190425, and prospects of GECKO in the fourth observing run (O4) of the GW detectors. We outline our follow-up observation strategies during O3. In particular, we describe our galaxy-targeted observation criteria that prioritize based on galaxy properties. Armed with this strategy, we performed an optical and/or near-infrared follow-up observation of GW190425, the first binary neutron star merger event during the O3 run. Despite a vast localization area of 7460 deg2, we observed 621 host galaxy candidates, corresponding to 29.5% of the scores we assigned, with most of them observed within the first 3 days of the GW event. Ten transients were discovered during this search, including a new transient with a host galaxy. No plausible KN was found, but we were still able to constrain the properties of potential KNe using upper limits. The GECKO observation demonstrates that GECKO can possibly uncover a GW170817-like KN at a distance <200 Mpc if the localization area is of the order of hundreds of square degrees, providing a bright prospect for the identification of GW electromagnetic wave counterparts during the O4 run.",imgName:"news-2.png",webpage:"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0238",webpage2:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19593"},{type:"publication",author:"Tak, Donggeun; Uhm, Z.

Despite its importance as a primary source of heavy elements through r-process nucleosynthesis, its nature is not well understood due to its rarity. In this work, we introduce a model that determines the density of a radially stratified relativistic ejecta. We apply the model to kilonova ejecta and explore several hypothesized velocity profiles as a function of the merger's ejection time. These velocity profiles result in diverse density profiles of the ejecta, for which we conduct radiative transfer simulations using TARDIS with the solar r-process composition. Consequently, we investigate the impact of the ejecta velocity profile on the resulting evolution of the lightcurve and spectra through the line transitions of heavy elements. The change in the rate at which these elements accumulate in the line-forming region leaves its imprint on the kilonova lightcurve at specific wavelengths, causing the lightcurves to decay at different rates. Furthermore, in several profiles, plateau-like behaviors (slow and/or flat decline) are also observed. In conclusion, this work proposes potential scenarios of the evolution of kilonova due to the ejecta velocity profile.",imgName:"news-1.png",webpage:"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad06b0",webpage2:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15608"}]};export{o as a};
